# CNN-CIFAR-10
 Using PyTorch and Keras seperately to tackle CIFAR-10 Dataset. Both use dropouts and data augmentation. I have made the PyTorch implementation
 fully object oriented, so it's easier to read and digest. Both the programs store their model and respective output graphs (accuracy and loss)
 in their seperate folders, so if you wish to test the model output for yourself, just retrieve the .h5 files.
